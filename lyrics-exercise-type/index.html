          <p>The hills were alive with wildflowers and I</p>
          <p>Was as wild, even wilder than they</p>
          <p>For at least I could run, they just died in the sun</p>
          <p>And I refused to just wither in place</p>
          <br>
          <p class="chorus">Just a wild mountain rose, needing freedom to grow</p>
          <p class="chorus">So I ran fearing not where I'd go</p>
          <p class="chorus">When a flower grows wild, it can always survive</p>
          <p class="chorus">Wildflowers don't care where they grow</p>
          <br>
          <p>And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew</p>
          <p>Were content to be lost in the crowd</p>
          <p>They were common and close, I had no room for growth</p>
          <p>I wanted so much to branch out</p>
          <br>
          <p class="chorus">I uprooted myself from my home ground and left</p>
          <p class="chorus">Took my dreams and I took to the road</p>
          <p class="chorus">When a flower grows wild, it can always survive</p>
          <p class="chorus">Wildflowers don't care where they grow</p>
          <br>
          <p>I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right</p>
          <p>In a garden so different from me</p>
          <p>I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone</p>
          <p>So the garden one day set me free</p>
          <br>
          <p class="chorus">So I hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend</p>
          <p class="chorus">I just let him decide where we'd go</p>
          <p class="chorus">When a flower grows wild, it can always survive</p>
          <p class="chorus">Wildflowers don't care where they grow</p>

        <h1>Intro Questions 9/22</h1>
        <p><h3>1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc.)</h3></p>
        <p>My name is Abby Sanderson (she/her) and I am a junior majoring in Communicatiion Design and minoring in Educational Studies</p>
        <p><h3>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</h3></p>
        <p>I am primarily taking this class for the major, but I am really personally interested in learning to code.</p>
        <p><h3>3.Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</h3></p>
        <p>I have used HTML and CSS in a <i>very</i> limited capacity, and only in my 8th grade typing class as a quick experiment. I do have a lot of friends in Computer Science, though, so I would like to understand more of what they do.</p>
        <p><h3>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</h3></p>
        <p>I would, overall, like to be proficient in HTML and feel like I could pick it up and work on a project on my own or for a job without having to learn everything at once.</p>
        <p><h3>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</h3></p>
        <p>Scale is always the first consideration for me in designing for the screen; In a desktop setting, type often had to be larger than in print media of the same size in inches. Also, the adaptability of my design across devices and platforms is a major consideration.</p>
        <p><h3>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</h3></p>
        <p><a><a href="https://www.franshalsmuseum.nl/en/">Frans Hals Museum</a> I like the design of this website because I think it does a nice job of creating a consitent theme and mood for a body of work. The use of color is more engaging than the standard academic style for museum websites.</p>
        <p><h3>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</h3></p>
        <p><a><a href="https://gorillaz-promo.com/">Gorillaz Promo</a> I really like this website for communicatiion because of its scroll mechanisms. The way that text is revealed or transformed not only fits with the Gorillaz's established aesthetic but does a nice job of telling the viewer what the band is about in an organic way. Interacting with the page almost feels like a conversation.</p>
        <p><h3>8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</h3></p>
        <p><a><a href="http://slaveryfootprint.org/">Slavery Footprint</a> I love the slavery footprint quiz. I think the way the little actions are designed makes them accessible and engaging while also forcing the viewer to really deeply consider how their actions contribute to slavery around the world. I also think this a great example of how a serious subject can be handled with a lighter, looser theme and still convey its importance.</p>
